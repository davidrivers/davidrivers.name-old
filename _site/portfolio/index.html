<h2 id='recommendations'>Recommendations</h2>

<h3 id='as_director_of_user_experience_at_weddzilla'>As Director of User Experience at Weddzilla</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I met David nearly a decade ago in an online, development discussion board. Having been managed by him at Weddzilla, I can attest to the honesty and passion that he displays in a professional context. He is insistent on doing things &#8220;the right way the first time&#8221;. Despite a volatile business environment and harried development schedule at Weddzilla, David managed to retain a balanced sense of perspective and effectively translate the business needs from the executive team into user stories and development iterations. As a stand-in project lead and scrum master, he had shown an ability to facilitate an air of open communication, that enabled a pivotal understanding of priorities and code functionality between our segmented team of developers. David is a natural leader and proficient developer. I look forward to working with him on future projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic server administration as well as development advice. In fact, it was David that convinced me to move to the Kohana PHP framework, which is now my go-to framework as it&#8217;s saved me weeks of work on future projects.</p>

<p>Hiring David to do work on ChiFix (www.chifix.com) was a very wise choice as he is extremely creative and did great work in the short amount of time I gave him to complete the task of designing, developing and deploying the site.
