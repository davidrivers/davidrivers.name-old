For someone who professes an interest in SEO, I feel like I am the last one to get the memo when I discovered earlier today that *Google indexes JavaScript*. I realized this when checking that Google finally <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kvSQE0qJOJQJ:davidrivers.name/">cached DavidRivers.name</a>. I think consensus dictates that JavaScript is ignored, but I imagine that Google prioritizes HTML over JavaScript content.

Apparently this keeps sites a little more honest in quelling black hat SEO attempts of keyword stuffing, and this is certainly something to consider within your overall SEO strategy.

I don't have anything else to say about this, but I will hopefully enlighten some others!
