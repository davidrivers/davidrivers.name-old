title: Yet Another Redesign of My Blog Site
keywords: redesign, site
description: Once again I have redesigned my rarely-used blog site.
---

Save blog entries about the redesigns themselves, I'm pretty sure that I have deployed more versions of my site than I have published articles to it. Nevertheless, this is yet another blog about my blogsite redesign. (As soon as I implement a tagging system this will be promptly filed under "who cares?".) This post will be updated with more details as I continue to the build out the site, improving user experience and posting more content...

## TODO

* Improve layouts and design
* Publish my portfolio
* Load-time optimization (esp. [LABjs](http://labjs.com/) or similar to defer loading of Disqus crap)
* Write better content for the homepage
* Generate a sitemap.xml
* Implement a tagging system
